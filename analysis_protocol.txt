Analysis protocol

1. Pick ROIs for each FOV and save them in one ROI.zip (avoid the first one if it goes out of focus)
    Things to keep in mind: Pick the last time-point such that all cells are still in focus - picked it to be 70 for this dataset
2. Run the extract_ROIs.ipynb to extract the BF images of the ROIs
3. Run YeastMate on the cropped BF files (make sure to have the pixel size accurate, 156 nm for Fire(2by2) at 60X)
4. Remove the "_mask" suffix so that the masks are compatible with acdc
5. Manually curate and edit masks and their tracks in acdc
6. Generate the plots
